# Matching an Email using Regular Expressions #

Regular Expressions, or regex, are sequences of characters that form a search pattern. These can be helpful in codis, as they are used to confirm the presence of a specific pattern in a string.


## Summary

In this gist, we will be examining the regex code for verifying that user input is a valid email address:

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

Each part of this expression gives specific instructions for what to search for or validate on a webpage. The above code specifies that an email address must:

* This must be followed by an ampersat (@), then 
* The ending of the string may include lowercase letters a-z and must be between 2 and 6 characters
